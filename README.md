Task 1 worksheet
We were tasked with creating our individual worksheet with stipulated guidelines
This file shows 20 rows of data containing the employee ID, employee full name, department (categorized into communications, sales and I.T), salary between $5000 to $25,000 and the job type which could be part-time, freelance or contract. 
The aforementioned headings were created in the columns and highlighted with a green background and white text for better differentiation and visibility. 
The original data set ie without any manipulation was named "ORIGINAL" worksheet. 
All data shown in the worksheet were formulated by me.
